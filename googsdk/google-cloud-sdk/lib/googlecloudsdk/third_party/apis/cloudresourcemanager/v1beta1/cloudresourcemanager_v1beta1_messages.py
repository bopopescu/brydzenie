  `Binding` binds a set of members to a role, where the members include user
  accounts, user groups, user domains, and service accounts. A 'role' is a
  named set of permissions, defined by IAM. The definition of a role is
  outside the policy.  A permission check first determines the roles that
  include the specified permission, and then determines if the principal
  specified is a member of a binding to at least one of these roles. The
  membership check is recursive when a group is bound to a role.  Policy
  examples:  ``` {   "bindings": [     {       "role": "roles/owner",
  "members": [         "user:mike@example.com",
  "group:admins@example.com",         "domain:google.com",
